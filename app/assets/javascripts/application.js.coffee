# Any JavaScript/Coffee file within this directory, lib/assets/javascripts, vendor/assets/javascripts,
# or any plugin's vendor/assets/javascripts directory can be referenced here using a relative path.

# It's not advisable to add code directly here, but if you do, it'll appear at the bottom of the
# compiled file.
